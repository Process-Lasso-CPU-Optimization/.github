## What is Process Lasso?

**Process Lasso** is a powerful and versatile utility designed to optimize system performance by managing process priorities, CPU affinities, and system responsiveness. Unlike traditional task managers, Process Lasso uses intelligent automation to ensure that background processes do not interfere with foreground applications, resulting in a smoother and more stable computing experience.

With Process Lasso, users can enjoy:
- Improved system responsiveness and reduced latency.
- Better gaming performance by prioritizing game processes.
- Prevention of system stalls and freezes caused by CPU overload.
- Automated process management without user intervention.

The software is compatible with all modern versions of Windows and is trusted by gamers, streamers, and professionals worldwide. Its proactive approach to system management makes it an essential tool for anyone looking to maximize their PC’s performance.
